# Personal Blog

Note: I modified `app/(payload)/graphql-playground/route.ts` to use [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql#readme) because the playground that was being used, [graphql-playground](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-playground), had not been updated in 7 years. And I ran into [this very annoying issue](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/issues/1429).
